Congrats, sidecar-controller is now running!

If you specify the `nrmitchi.com/sidecars` annotation on a pod, with a comma-separated list of container names, the pod
will be automatically shut down if the specified sidecar containers are the only ones still running.

Example:

```
annotations:
  nrmitchi.com/sidecars: "veneur,log-forwarder,cloudsql-proxy"
```
